# Create a Slack Alerts Obot

This is a short tutorial demonstrating how to create an **Obot** that helps with alerts in a Slack channel.

> **Note:**
> As you configure the obot, changes are saved and applied automatically â€” no need to click "Save".

## 1. Setting up the Obot

Start by visiting [Obot](https://obot.ai) scroll down and click **+ New Obot** to begin creating one.  

In the **General** section on the left side:  

- Set a **Name** and **Description** for the obot (e.g., "Slack Alerts Helper").  
- Write **Instructions** to tell the obot what you want it to do. Be specific about which Slack channel contains the alerts, and what systems or types of alerts to expect.  

```text
You are a smart assistant with expertise in Kubernetes and access to the Slack API.  
Please help me with my alerts in Slack. They are in the channel #alerts.  
```

Hereâ€™s what the editor looks like when starting a new obot:  

## 2. Adding Slack Tools

To give the obot access to Slack, scroll down to the **Tools** section in the left sidebar.  

- Click **+ Add Tool**.  
- Search for `Slack`.  
- Youâ€™ll see a category of Slack tools appear â€” click the toggle on the right side of that category to add all Slack-related tools to your obot.  

This allows the obot to read alerts from Slack channels and respond appropriately.  

## 3. Testing the Obot

Once configured, you can test the obot using the **chat interface** on the right side of the editor.  

Try asking it something like:  

```text
What alerts have fired today?
Which alerts have fired more than once?
```

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** The first time the obot tries to interact with Slack, youâ€™ll be prompted to log in and authorize access to your Slack account.  

You can also ask the obot to suggest remediation steps for specific alerts.  

## 4. Sharing the Obot (Optional)

If youâ€™re satisfied with how the obot works and want others to use it:  

- Use the **Share** section in the left sidebar to manage access.  
- Click **Share** and copy the link to share with others.
